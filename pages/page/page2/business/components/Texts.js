              Agri business is one of the most flourishing sectors of the
              industry and Ramaera Industries are planning to set forth its foot
              in this industry as well.&nbsp;
            </span>
            We plan to play the role of the input providers, producers,
            processors as well as service providers in agribusiness. The
            ultimate motive is mainly to monitor transparency and supervised
            operations to provide qualitative product delivery at the customer
            end.

            This agribusiness initiative by the Ramaera industry aims to solve
            two major issues in the supply chain system of agricultural business
            namely the over-chemical processing of fruits and vegetables poses a
            severe threat to the consumers and the second is providing a good
            resourceful percentage of revenue to the farmers owing to the unfair
            practices being laid on the farmers.

            Chemical processing is laying severe risk to the health of children
            increasing the threat of cardiovascular diseases and cancer. There
            have been cases of an increase in breathing problems and lung
            diseases. Many ill practices are going on in the agricultural
            industry such as artificial ripening, adulteration, and also unfair
            pay practices. Ramaera Industries plans to eradicate these practices
            to provide the best to our consumers to make the nation immune and
            healthy.

            Ramaera Industries Agribusiness is a safer alternative to the
            conventional farming method. Organic farming will utilise natural
            and harm-free methods completely avoiding the use of chemical
            fertilisers just for the greed of yield. Utilising safer
            technological alternatives, we aim to provide a resourceful yield
            that is free from the chemical hazards of farming.

            There are numerous health benefits to consuming organic fruits and
            vegetables. Recent studies show that organic fruits and vegetables
            have a higher level of antioxidants as compared to the ones grown
            through conventional farming. Organic fruits and vegetables have a
            higher nutritional value as compared to the latter. Apart from this,
            we aim to achieve various sustainable goals through our Organic
            Agribusiness such as mitigating carbon levels in the atmosphere and
            managing soil erosion. Organic Agribusiness also aims to deliver
            nutritious and fresh fruits right to your homes, saving you time and
            providing you with health with ease. Order a variety of fruits and
